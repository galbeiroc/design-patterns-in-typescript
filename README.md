### Overview

TypeScript is a tool to help you write type-safe JavaScript. JavaScript is a weakly typed language which means that types are assigned implicitly as they are used at runtime. While this can be considered a feature, it can be dangerous if your code needs to be treating types precisely at all times. Enforcing type safety ensures that all usage of the properties, functions and classes are consistent within your application and as a result makes your application more robust.
